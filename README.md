Low Value Care project at CEVR, Tufts Medical Center

## Source data

This project uses CMS LDS data, including inpatient data (100%,
2017-2020), outpatient data (100%, 2017-2020), carrier data (5%,
2017-2020).

Each inpatient claim file consists of two files: inpatient base-claim
file and inpatient revenue-center file.

Each outpatient claim file consists of two files: outpatient base-claim
file and outpatient revenue-center file.

Each carrier claim file consists of two files: carrier base-claim file
and carrier line file.

## Steps of Processing

### 1. Split claim files

The claim file is too large for SAS to process. This step splits the
large claim file into smaller chunk files so that SAS can easily process
each chunk file .

Each claim-base file will be divided into many smaller chunk files, each
containing approximately 1,000,000 claims. The line/revenue file is also
divided into smaller chunk files containing the same claims as in the
corresponding base-claim chunk file.

We wrote a powershell script (*chunk.ps1*) to split claim files.

### 2. Transform claim file (01\_ETL.SAS)

This step merges claim-base file and line/revenue file into one claim
file, with each record containing all ICD and HCPCS codes.

### 3. Flag conditions (02\_FLAG.SAS)

This step scans HCPCS/ICD-10/BETOS/DRG codes from
inpatient/outpatient/carrier claims for 84 comorbidities and creates
variables to indicate each condition found. The 84 conditions include 33
HCPCS conditions, 48 ICD conditions, 2 BETOS conditions and 1 DRG
condition.

After this step of processing, there will be approximately 150 output
files, including 48(4 years\*12 chunks) inpatient flag files, 48(4
year\*12 chunks) outpatient flag files, and 48 (4 year\*12 chunks)
carrier flag files.

### 4. Re-Grouping flag files by ID (Not implemented yet)

Simply combining all the year and type files into one large combined
flags file is too large to handle in SAS. Each flag file will be split
by id, so flag files of a subgroup of ids can be combined, resulting in
a smaller combined flag file that SAS can process separately.

### 5. Create Date variables (03\_DATES.SAS)

The Low-Value-Care algorithm need the check individual’s claim history
of conditions.

|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| firstLastPrevDates | Create variables for the earliest date, the last date, and the previous date of each of 35 conditions, which will be used in low-value-care algorithms. |
| nextDate           | Create variables for the next date of each of 3 conditions, which will be used in some low-value-care algorithms                                        |

### 6. Label Low-Value-Care (04\_ALGORITHMS.SAS)

This step labels low-value care based on various LVC
definitions(algorithm).

The input file for each LVC algorithm is
“claims\_all\_flag\_\[chunkid\]\_FLPDx\_nextDx.sas8bdat” which is the
output of the “Create Date Variables” step.
